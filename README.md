# Undiecar UI

An initial attempt at fixing problems associated with using the official iRacing UI.

This is VERY pre-alpha. Like REALLY alpha, like actually more alpha than the official iRacing Beta UI! This seems to work, but it has had very little testing and is more of a demonstration of concept rather than a tool that I think people will make use of. I may use it myself shortly, as although it is awkward, it can't be more awkward than the iRacing Beta UI is. Feel free to use it, but I make no claims of it not driving you more crazy than the official UI ;)


## Getting Started

Install this Chrome extension as an unpacked extension.


## What does it do?

Right now? Not a lot. It adds a really ugly box to the hosted races page, which contains a dummy example string of text. You can modify that string to select which settings you wish to use in your hosted session.


## What is it for?

For when you can't handle bashing your head against a wall repeatedly, trying to use the iRacing Beta UI. But sometimes you really really really badly want the features which are only available when hosting sessions through the iRacing Beta UI


## FAQ

Actually, nobody has asked any questions yet ... I'm just pre-empting them.

### Is the iRacing Beta UI really that bad?

Yes. Yes it is.

### Is this better than the iRacing Beta UI?

No. No it isn't. It is however totally different and is a lot easier to customise to your needs.

### What perks are there to using it?

You can copy/paste the dummy string and use it for future events, just modifying it to suit your needs. You can also implement features which aren't possible in the official iRacing web UI, such as accelerated time and specifying exact times of day.

### Isn't this a bit too complicated just to implement a race at a particular time of day, with accelerated time?

Yep, it is. But I'm hoping it will be less time consuming and perhaps a little more trustworthy.

### What does that string of code looking stuff mean and how do I use it?

I'm not going to sit here and work out/document all that out for you ;) I may consider turning it into a proper UI at some point.

### This seems less like UI and more like a nasty hack to solve a problem ...

Pretty much. You seem to have hit the nail on the head there.

## What's your beef with the iRacing Beta UI?

It has sucked up too much of my time. It doesn't work. I hate it. I want it gone and out of my life.

## Why did you make it?

Partially out of interest, partially to stop myself from launching my PC out the window whenever I was stuck having to use the new iRacing Beta UI.

## How did you figure out the API?

Poking around. Somebody on the iRacing forum mentioned that https://members-ng.iracing.com/ is the location of the new Beta UI, and that it was in fact just a web UI wrapped within a native app. As soon as I realised this was the case, I realised it was probably possible to hack in our own system and build our own UI on top of iRacing. A few hours later and this weird little gizmo was born.

## Could you use this system to make a proper full-blown UI?

Yes, but that takes time. If it were for a non-profit organisation I would probably start work on something immediately. But iRacing is a commercial entity which charges me quite a bit of money just to play a game, so spending a lot of my free time on this is not high on my priority list.

## What is this licensed under?

Dunno. I haven't thought that far ahead yet. Feel free to steal it and use it for your own purposes though, particularly if you are going to contribute your code back to the community.
